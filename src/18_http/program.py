# Chapter 18: Working with APIs (Simulated with Flask in a Single Script)

"""
Introduction:
In this chapter, we will simulate an interaction with an API by setting up a local Flask web service to return mock weather data. The script will both run the Flask web server and send a request to the server to fetch and process the weather data.

Key Concepts:
1. **APIs**: APIs allow different software systems to communicate and exchange data. They expose endpoints where you send requests and get responses.
2. **Simulating API Calls**: We simulate API calls using a local Flask server, which returns mock data when queried.
3. **HTTP Requests and JSON Parsing**: We will use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and parse the returned JSON data.

Notes:
- The Flask server will run locally in the background while the program fetches data from it.
- This is a great way to practice API requests and responses before interacting with real APIs.

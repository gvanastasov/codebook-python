Introduction:
This chapter introduces Python, a beginner-friendly programming language, 
and guides you through the steps to set up Python on your computer.
You'll also learn how to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your development environment.

To get started:
1. Install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/.
2. Set up VS Code as your Python editor.
3. Verify your setup by running this simple program.
    - `python program.py` in terminal (or use code runner extension in VS Code)

Remember:
- Comments in Python help document your code for better understanding.
- Use # for single-line comments.
- Use triple quotes (or ''') for multi-line comments.

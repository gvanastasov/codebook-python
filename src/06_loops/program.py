# Chapter 06: Loops: for and while

"""
Introduction:
Loops are a fundamental programming construct that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. 
This chapter introduces `for` and `while` loops, showing how to use them for iteration, and control their flow with `break` and `continue`.

Key Concepts:
1. `for` Loops: Iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range).
2. `while` Loops: Repeat as long as a condition is true.
3. Loop Control: Use `break` to exit a loop early, or `continue` to skip to the next iteration.
4. Nested Loops: A loop inside another loop for handling more complex scenarios.

Notes:
- Use `for` loops when the number of iterations is known or youâ€™re iterating over a collection.
- Use `while` loops when the iterations depend on a condition being met.
- Avoid infinite loops by ensuring `while` conditions eventually become false.
